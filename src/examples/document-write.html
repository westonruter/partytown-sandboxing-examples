    <h1>Sandboxing document.write()</h1>

    <p>
      Calling <code>document.write()</code> is generally a bad idea. Calling it
      during page load forces the browser to pause rendering while waiting for a
      script to execute. Even worse, calling after the page loads will cause the
      entire page to be replaced with whatever is written. This means
      `document.write()` is inherently bad since it cannot be executed
      asynchronously. Indeed, attempting to call
      <code>document.write()</code> from a <code>module</code> script results in
      a warning in DevTools: <q>Failed to execute 'write' on 'Document': It isn't
      possible to write into a document from an asynchronously-loaded external
      script unless it is explicitly opened.</q>
      Interestingly, Partytown does not override <code>document.write()</code> by default
      but we can enable async execution by implementing it ourselves. Note that this works
      the same with and without Partytown.
    </p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
      document.write = ( text ) => {
        const div = document.createElement('div');
        div.innerHTML = text;
        if ( document.currentScript ) {
          document.currentScript.parentNode.insertBefore( div, document.currentScript );
        } else {
          document.body.appendChild( div );
        }
      };
    </script>

    <p>Now to demonstrate intercepting post-load <code>document.write()</code> calls in a script that has been made asynchronous:</p>

    <button>Simulate async call to <code>document.write()</code></button>

    <script type="text/javascript">
      document.write("<p>This paragraph was written with <code>document.write()</code> during page load.</p>");

      document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', () => {
        document.write( '<p>This content was injected with <code>document.write()</code> after page load!</p>' );
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
